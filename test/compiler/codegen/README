## Running tests
[!] FROM ROOT OF PROJECT [!]
./test/compiler/codegen/test_runner.sh

## Adding tests
In swift_samples, add new .swift file with code. This file is then compiled into .swift.ifjcode file in compiled_codes
directory. This file is then used as input for the interpreter

[!] Careful, compiled_codes directory is cleaned after start of test_runner.sh (not after because we might want to
observe the compiled code)
